# FL-SMLM: Demonstartion of TCSPC pattern matching

This repository contains example code that demonstrates how TCSPC pattern matching can be applied for the classification of single molecules or as an efficent way to perform an MLE grid search.

The scripts process the output files of [TrackNTrace](github.com/scstein/TrackNTrace). Example data is provided in the subfolder _tntres_. The correponding raw data can be found [here](https://projects.gwdg.de/projects/cfl-smlm/repository).
